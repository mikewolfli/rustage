# Documentation

## Suggested reading order

1. [Project overview](../README.md): current status and scope.
2. [Principles](plan/principle.md): engineering constraints.
3. [Whitepaper](plan/whitepaper.md): architecture, output modes, and hot updates.
4. [Full roadmap](plan/roadmap.md): features, menus, tasks, and milestone acceptance.
5. [Contribution guide](../CONTRIBUTING.md): workflow and checks.
6. [GitHub administration](github.md): owner-managed repository settings.

Related design evidence: [Capability planning references](plan/capability-reference.md)
records workflow requirements, protocol evidence, and future-extension boundaries.
It informs roadmap scope, not claims of implemented capabilities.

[Icon and resource plan](plan/resources.md) defines host/project resource boundaries,
source placement, rust-widgets integration constraints, and packaging acceptance.
Its host source layer is implemented in `resources/` with checks in `tools/resources/`;
the icon seam and the control-level strip are `src/resources/` and `src/app/toolbar.rs`,
with baselines under `tests/baselines/icons/`.

[Issue record](issues/issue-20261013.md) tracks the icon, resource and packaging gaps and the
order they are being closed in. It is a work list, not a statement of implemented capability.

## Records

- [Resource structure and files](log/log-20261013-1.md): what was added, the commands that ran,
  and what remains unverified.
- [Glyph design, theme contract and HarmonyOS packaging](log/log-20261013-2.md): the minimal
  monoline glyph language, the verified HarmonyOS desktop manifest and resource layer, and the
  evidence each of them rests on.
- [Icons reaching real controls](log/log-20261013-3.md): the pinned dependency, the semantic icon
  seam, the eight roles mapped onto the dependency's own theme, the real-control baselines, and
  what is still not verified (a window, interaction states, RTL).

## Boundaries

Community documents and GitHub templates primarily use English.
The README is bilingual; the design documents in `plan/` use Chinese.

Design documents are not claims of implemented features.
Historical upstream evidence in the whitepaper must be checked against the
actual revision before implementation.
Completing a roadmap task requires implementation and acceptance evidence,
not merely checking off its description.

Upstream material belongs to
[rust-widgets](https://github.com/mikewolfli/rust-widgets).
This repository does not copy upstream code or count library capabilities as
completed designer features.
Upstream default-branch documents may change; record commit SHAs for implementation baselines.

Add new documents to this index and applicable README sections.
Keep both README versions consistent when project status or scope changes.
